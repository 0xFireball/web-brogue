Linux has a limit on the backlog of datagram packets that can wait in the queue.

cat /proc/sys/net/unix/max_dgram_qlen

On the digital ocean server this is 10, which causes EAGAIN on sending very quickly when using the mouse.

It is probably wise to increase this (as root):

sysctl -w net.unix.max_dgram_qlen=128

(it is 512 on my debian dev box)
