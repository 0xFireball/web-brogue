#19

When a chat window update occurs, you lose current focus, which is annoying when you are typing a message (otherwise not a big deal, since console is default focus)

#1

If you create a new user, that user does not exist but their directory exists, you get:
Server Error: {"errno":-17,"code":"EEXIST","path":"/home/flend/web-brogue/game-data/flend"}
at the client

#17

Seems to be possible to login with local credentials, even if that user has been deleted from the database

#16

You can register with no user name, which is then problematic for others observing your game etc.

#13

If 2 windows are logged in as the same user and the game ends, the high score is recorded twice

#14

Sometimes high scores appear not to be recorded - reason unclear - observed on live server
This turned out to be due to the child process exit event triggering before the event listener had completed

#11

#8

After logging out in another window (?) in-game chat leaks into lobby

After finishing a game and starting a new one, the 'current games' entry still had the old amount of gold
The front end is receiving the wrong value via WS

#2

The google console font does not have a glyph for:
-Undiscovered items
-Goblin totems

#3

The seed is truncated in the high score table
